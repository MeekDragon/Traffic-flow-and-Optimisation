# Traffic-flow-and-Optimisation
A Python-based desktop application designed to enhance urban traffic management through data analysis, machine learning, and optimization algorithms. The project leverages the PyQt5 framework to simulate real-time traffic scenarios and optimize traffic signal timings.

Overview
The Trafficflow_Optmisation project aims to:

Analyze traffic data to pinpoint bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
Implement adaptive traffic signal control and other optimization algorithms.
Simulate traffic scenarios to evaluate and improve flow patterns.
This tool is ideal for urban planners, researchers, and developers interested in optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion.

Features
Traffic Data Analysis:
Processes traffic data to identify areas where improvements are needed.

Optimization Algorithms:
Uses advanced algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control and overall traffic flow enhancement.

Simulation Environment:
Provides a simulation to test various optimization strategies in real-time.

User-Friendly GUI:
Built with PyQt5, the application offers an intuitive interface with a splash screen, setup, and login options.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/ishanar20/Trafficflow_Optmisation.git
cd Trafficflow_Optmisation
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

If a requirements.txt file is available, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If no requirements.txt exists, manually install the required packages (e.g., PyQt5, numpy, pandas, matplotlib) based on your projectâ€™s needs.

Usage
Run the main program using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python MainProgram.py
How It Works
Splash Screen:
On launch, a splash screen is displayed for 3 seconds using an image (slash_img.jpg).

Conditional Flow:

If config.json exists, the application proceeds to the login screen.
If config.json is missing, the installation/setup window is shown to configure the project.
Configuration
config.json:
Customize this file to configure settings like traffic parameters, database connections, and other options.

Resource Files:

slash_img.jpg: Image used for the splash screen.
traffic_data.csv: Sample traffic data for simulation and analysis.
Ensure these files are properly set up to match your environment and requirements.
